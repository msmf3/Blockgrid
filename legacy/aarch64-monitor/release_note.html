    <p>This software release is an example code for a Secure Monitor for ARMv8.</p>
    
    <p>This version was validated with the v4.7 release of the AEMv8A RTSM models (see ARM <a  href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/instruction-set-architectures/armv8-architecture.php">armv8-architecture</a> web page) and has been built
    and tested using publicly available Linaro GCC toolchains <a href="http://www.linaro.org/engineering/armv8#tab3">Linaro</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="deliverables" id="deliverables">Deliverables</a></h3>

    <p>This release contains the following file:</p>

    <dl class="manifest">
      <dt>aarch64-monitor-2013-04.tar.bz2</dt>

      <dd>This contains the source code and makefile for a simple example of a Trustzone Secure
      Monitor program which can be used to switch between a Secure and Non-secure execution context
      on an ARMv8 processor. The package also contains pre-built binaries of the example and a
      script to aid running the example on the ARMv8 RTSM model.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>For installation requirements and instructions, please see the <a href="#installation">Installation</a>
    details below.</p>

    <h3><a name="functionality-included" id="functionality-included">Functionality
    included</a></h3>

    <p>This is reference code to illustrate how the ARM Security Extensions can be used in ARMv8 to
    implement the EL3 Secure Monitor program in AArch64. It also provides a reference of
    architecturally accurate CPU initialization, assuming only the minimal reset state documented
    in the Architecture specification.</p>

    <p>AArch64 no longer provides banked versions of the system and coprocessor register state for
    Secure and Non-secure processor modes, thus the monitor program must now save and restore
    additional processor state for the EL0 and EL1 context in order to provide an entirely
    independent and secure domain for Trusted OS and applications.</p>

    <p>This secure monitor program provides per-CPU context save and restore code for switching
    between secure and non-secure domains in response to an <span class="mono">SMC</span> instruction, covering
    all of the required architected processor register state. In this example the SMC call always
    switches domain, and passes the <span class="mono">X0-X3</span> (AArch32 <span class="mono">R0-R3</span>) registers to
    the 'other side' - a simple form of ABI. This is not essential for a monitor program but
    illustrates one such possible ABI. This example also shows per-CPU lazy switching of the full
    floating point/NEON register state between secure and non-secure domains.</p>

    <p>The monitor program example does not include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>management of interrupts and timers for the secure and non-secure domains, and trapping
      interrupts for the non-current domain to the monitor</li>

      <li>enabling the MMU and use of the non-secure EL1 and EL2 and secure EL1 and EL3 memory
      translation systems - although all relevant MMU control registers are managed by the example
      monitor</li>

      <li>save and restore of implementation specific CPU state</li>

      <li>save and restore of the full CPU state as required for CPU power management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unlike AArch32, AArch64 specifies only the minimal necessary requirements for processor
    register state on reset. This example program also includes a full, correct initialization of
    the architected CPU state required to run the example code. Note that not all CPU state is
    initialized in this example code as not all CPU features are used, for example, the MMU and
    caches are not currently used in the example code.</p>

    <p>This example makes use of the modeling of secure and non-secure memory within the ARMv8
    model (model parameter <span class="mono">daughterboard.secure_memory=true</span>). The model is strict:
    secure memory can only accessed from secure state, non-secure memory can only be accessed from
    non-secure state except when the NS or NSTable bits are used in a secure translation table. The
    model's full memory map is described in the linker script <span class=
    "mono">memory.lds</span>, which is then used by the other linker scripts in order to
    define the load and run addresses for the programs in this example.</p>

    <p>This example can run on multi-core models (up to 4 CPUs), in which case each CPU executes
    precisely the same code, but uses a separate region of RAM for the CPU secure and non-secure
    context. The <span class="mono">runexample.sh</span> script provided sets the number of
    CPUs to one (model parameter <span class="mono">cluster_NUM_CORES=1</span>) as this makes observation of the
    monitor program more obvious in the debugger.</p>

    <p>The programs that are used for the secure and non-secure domains in this example are simple
    loops that repeatedly invoke <span class="mono">SMC</span> to switch to the other domain. They make use of a
    'shared' register <span class="mono">X0/R0</span> (based on the SMC ABI protocol in this example) and a
    non-shared register <span class="mono">X4/R4</span>; and also occasionally use the floating point register
    set. This provides a basic illustration of the context save and restore and the lazy nature of
    the floating point context switch.</p>

    <p>Both AArch64 and AArch32 versions of the secure and non-secure domain programs are provided.
    The non-secure programs can be run either in hypervisor (EL2/hyp) or kernel (EL1/svc) modes.
    The AArch32 programs can be compiled in either ARM or THUMB instruction set. The choice of
    programs to use can be specified when running the example in the model debugger using the
    provided <span class="mono">runexample.sh</span> script (see <a href="#usage">Usage</a>
    below for more details).</p>

    <p>It is also possible to use other programs for the secure and/or non-secure domains. The
    programs need to start with a small data structure describing the code: this structure is
    outlined at the start of <span class="mono">monitor.64.S</span> and can be seen in the
    other assembler source files (e.g. <span class="mono">secure.64.S</span>). Note that
    AArch32 THUMB entry point references must have bit 0 set in the conventional manner. The
    programs also need to be linked to run and load at the correct addresses to work with the
    supplied monitor program, refer to <span class="mono">secure.lds</span> and <span class=
    "mono">non_secure.lds</span> for details of how this can be specified in conjunction with
    <span class="mono">memory.lds</span>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="new-features" id="new-features">New features</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The software is now built using publicly available toolchains from Linaro for both AArch32 (ARM)
       and AArch64 code.</li>
    </ul>      
      
    <h3><a name="known-issues" id="known-issues">Known issues</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The AArch32 GNU toolchains have only recently included support for the 
      <span class="mono">VMRS Rn, FPEXC</span> instruction forms (from binutils 2.23.1). This example
      code currently uses the explicit forms of <span class="mono">MRC</span> instructions to access 
      this register allowing older toolchains to be used.</li>

      <li style="list-style: none"><br /></li>

      <li>Loading application code into the non-secure memory of the ARMv8 model at start-up is not
      possible, as the CPU is in secure state and access to the non-secure memory map is not
      permitted by the model core. To work-around this limitation but keep the example simple, a
      small model script (see <span class="mono">runexample.sh</span>) is used to copy the
      non-secure code from a secure-memory load address (in this case <span class="mono">0x7ff00000</span>) to
      the non-secure memory run address (in this case <span class="mono">0x80000000</span>).<br />
      <br />
      A production system would use the MMU and a suitably configured page translation to map and
      mark the non-secure memory in the secure page tables in order to load and copy the non-secure
      OS/loader code into RAM.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="test-cases" id="test-cases">Test cases and results</a></h3>

    <p>No test cases as such are included with this example code. Operation of the monitor program
    should be observed by tracing execution in the model debugger.</p>
    
    <p>Using the provided script (see <a href="#usage">Usage</a> below) and running the program,
    execution should first halt at entry to the secure program (at address <span class="mono">7E000010</span>).
    Running on, execution should next halt at entry to the non-secure program (at address 
    <span class="mono">80000010</span>). After this the program will not break again unless additional breakpoints
    are set.
    
    <p>Breaking into the program while it runs should show register <span class="mono">X0</span> incrementing 
    (once for each switch from secure to non-secure or vice-versa), <span class="mono">X4</span> incrementing at 
    half this rate in the secure program and <span class="mono">X4</span> decrementing in the non-secure program. 
    The floating point registers will also hold different values in the secure and non secure 
    programs.</p>    
    
    <p>The mode switching and lazy floating point context switching can be observed by instruction
    stepping from the SMC and floating point instructions in the secure and non-secure programs
    or by setting breakpoints on the monitor program <span class="mono">CPTR_trap</span> and <span class="mono">SMC_64</span> 
    labels.</p>
    
    <p>Running the example results in some expected diagnostic output from the "Debug Engine" relating to 
    failure to find an entry point. Details are provided in the <a href="#usage">Usage</a> section
    below.</p>

    <h3><a name="installation-instructions" id="installation-instructions">Installation instructions</a></h3>

		<p>Unpacking the tar file with the following command</p>
		
    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">tar -xjf aarch64-monitor-2013-04.tar.bz2</span>
    </blockquote>

		<p>will create a <span class="mono">./aarch64-monitor</span> directory which contains all of the
		documentation, source files and pre-built binaries.</p>

    <h3><a name="build-instructions" id="build-instructions">Build instructions</a></h3>

    <p>Paths and prefixes for the AArch64 and AArch32 GNU toolchains must be set in the
    <span class="mono">config</span> file. The <span class="mono">ARM_AARCH64_GNU_TOOLS</span> and
    <span class="mono">ARM_AARCH32_GNU_TOOLS</span> variables must refer to the appropriate GNU tool chains such
    that <span class="mono">$(ARM_AARCH32_GNU_TOOLS)gcc</span> would invoke the AArch32 GCC compiler and
    likewise for the AArch64 toolchain.</p>
    
    <p>Optionally, the following config parameters can be modified as needed to match the platform:</p>

    <dl class="manifest">
      <dt>ARM_HAS_THUMB2EE</dt>

      <dd>This parameter must indicate if ThumbEE is supported by the platform. The default
      is zero ('not implemented') and should be set to one to include support for ThumbEE. This
      config parameter also controls the visibility of ThumbEE support in the RTSM_VE_AEMv8A model 
      when invoked via the <span class="mono">./runexample.sh</span> script.</dd>
      
      <dt>ARM_HAS_AARCH32_EL1</dt>
      
      <dd>This parameter must indicate if AArch32 is implemented at EL1 in the platform. The defaults
      is one ('implemented') and should be set to zero to exclude support for AArch32 at EL1. This 
      config parameter also controls the availability of AArch32 support at EL1 in the RTSM_VE_AEMv8A
      model when invoked via the <span class="mono">./runexample.sh</span> script.</dd>
    </dl>  
    
    <p>Then from the directory with the source code, the command</p>

    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">make</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will build the AArch64 secure monitor program, and the AArch64 and AArch32 versions of the
    secure and non-secure domain programs.</p>

    <p>The AArch32 programs can be built in either the THUMB or ARM instruction set, this is
    controlled in the example code by the <span class="mono">THUMB</span> macro passed to the compilation as
    shown in the <span class="mono">Makefile</span>.</p>

    <p>For a quick start, the binaries for all of the example programs are already included with
    this package.</p>

    <h3><a name="usage" id="usage">Usage</a></h3>

    <p>Paths for the ARM ModelDebugger and RTSM AEMv8 model must be set in the <span class="mono">
    config</span> file. Note that the RTSM model license file/server may have to be set in the
    <span class="mono">config</span> file (variable <span class="mono">ARM_MODEL_LICENSE</span>) if
    the license is not already provided in the shell environment variable <span class="mono">
    ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE</span>.
    
    Optionally the RTSM model license file/server can be set in the
     file.</p>

    <p>With the environment set up, invoking the example in the model can be done from the example
    code directory using the <span class="mono">runexample.sh</span> script:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">./runexample.sh</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This will load the monitor program and the AArch64 secure and non-secure example programs
    into the ARMv8 model, and then set breakpoints at the entry points to the secure and non-secure
    domains. Stepping or running the code from this point will show the interaction between the
    secure and non-secure programs via the monitor.</p>

    <p>Note that when run, this example generates the following expected console output:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">
      terminal_0: Listening for serial connection on port 5000<br />
      terminal_1: Listening for serial connection on port 5001<br />
      terminal_2: Listening for serial connection on port 5002<br />
      terminal_3: Listening for serial connection on port 5003<br />
      INFO: mmc: no image file connected<br />
      DebugEngine: SetPCToApplicationEntryPoint was unable to set PC. Could not find application entry point.<br />
      DebugEngine: SetPCToApplicationEntryPoint was unable to set PC. Could not find application entry point.<br />
      DebugEngine: SetPCToApplicationEntryPoint was unable to set PC. Could not find application entry point.<br />
      </span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The "unable to set PC" messages are a side-effect of using a model script to load the
    three executables before setting the initial entry point manually.
    The script explicitly sets the entry point once all the applications are loaded.</p>
    
    <p>The AArch32 versions of the secure and/or non-secure domain programs can be selected instead
    of the default AArch64 programs using the <span class="mono">-s 32</span> and <span class="mono">-n 32</span> options to
    <span class="mono">runexample.sh</span>. Note that running AArch32 programs requires that the
    <span class="mono">ARM_HAS_AARCH32_EL1</span> option is set to one.</p>
    
    <p>For example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">./runexample.sh -n 32</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will run the monitor example using the supplied AArch64 secure program and AArch32
    non-secure program. Alternative secure or non-secure programs can also be specified by
    providing the full name of the image file to the <span class="mono">-n</span> or 
    <span class="mono">-s</span> options. E.g.

    <blockquote>
      <span class="mono">./runexample.sh -s my_secure_image.elf</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will run the monitor example using the supplied AArch64 non-secure program and a
    user-provided secure program <span class="mono">my_secure_image.elf</span>. See <a href=
    "#functionality-included">Functionality included</a> above about requirements on such a
    program.</p>

    <p>[Note that when secure memory is enabled in the model, breakpoints are specific to a
    particular processor state, as seen in the <em>Memory Space</em> options in the various
    debugger windows: <em>Secure Monitor</em> is required for breakpoints in the EL3 monitor
    program, <em>Guest</em> can be used for breakpoints in secure or non-secure EL1/svc code and
    <em>NS Hyp</em> is required for breakpoints in non-secure EL2/hypervisor code.]</p>
